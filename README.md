# Overview  
Each file contains 1* string "flag" that you need to find, of the form `flag{some_text}`.
It may be an input you provide to the file, a constant used in an expression or hidden within other variables.

# Compatibility
All files were tested on windows and linux on python 3.12.1. If you experience any issues getting a challenge to run 
(all challenges should exit normally when executed in script mode), make sure you're on python 3.12 **.1** 
installed via the msi installer from python.org (if you're on windows) and try downloading the file again.
If you still experience issues, send me a message on discord @`sand_trees` or make a github issue.

# Note
The version of `crypt0.py` in this repo is different to the one on the MMCTF webpage, fixing a minor bug present in the original. 
It's still possible to get the flag from either version, but if you had trouble figuring out what to do next the fix should make it clear.
